I came to Medina and encamped at Quba', and gave birth at Quba'. Then I brought the child to Allah's Apostle and placed it (on his lap). He asked for a date, chewed it, and put his saliva in the mouth of the child. So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Allah's Apostle. Then he did its Tahnik with a date, and invoked Allah to bless him. It was the first child born in the Islamic era, therefore they (Muslims) were very happy with its birth, for it had been said to them that the Jews had bewitched them, and so they would not produce any offspring.","by":"Narrated by Asma' bint Abu Bakr"},{"id":379,"text":"Abu Talha had a child who was sick. Once, while Abu Talha was out, the child died. When Abu Talha returned home, he asked, \"How does my son fare?\" Um Salaim (his wife) replied, \"He is quieter than he has ever been.\" Then she brought supper for him and he took his supper and slept with her. When he had finished, she said (to him), \"Bury the child (as he's dead).\" Next morning Abu Talha came to Allah's Apostle and told him about that. The Prophet said (to him), \"Did you sleep with your wife last night?\" Abu Talha said, \"Yes\". The Prophet said, \"O Allah! Bestow your blessing on them as regards that night of theirs.\" Um Sulaim gave birth to a boy. Abu Talha told me to take care of the child till it was taken to the Prophet. Then Abu Talha took the child to the Prophet and Um Sulaim sent some dates along with the child. The Prophet took the child (on his lap) and asked if there was something with him. The people replied, \"Yes, a few dates.\" The Prophet took a date, chewed it, took some of it out of his mouth, put it into the child's mouth and did Tahnik for him with that, and named him 'Abdullah.","by":"Narrated by Anas bin Malik"},{"id":379,"text":"As above.","by":"Narrated by Anas"},{"id":380,"text":"I heard Allah's Apostle saying, \"'Aqiqa is to be offered for a (newly born) boy, so slaughter (an animal) for him, and relieve him of his suffering.\" (Note: It has been quoted in Fateh-AL-Bari that the majority of the Religious Scholars agrees to the Hadith narrated in Sahih At-TlRMlZY that the Prophet was asked about Aqiqa and he ordered 2 sheep for a boy and one sheep for a girl and that is his tradition \"SUNNA\".)","by":"Narrated by Salman bin 'Amir Ad-Dabbi"},{"id":381,"text":"Ibn Sirin told me to ask Al-Hassan from whom he had heard the narration of 'Aqiqa.
